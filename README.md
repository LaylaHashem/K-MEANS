# K-MEANS
K-Means Clustering on Synthetic Data
1. Problem Statement
 The goal is to simulate an abstract clustering problem using synthetic data, apply the
 K-Means clustering algorithm to group the data and evaluate its performance.
 This involves generating data, preprocessing it, determining the optimal number
 of clusters, clustering the data, and visualizing the results.
 2. Methodology
 2.1 Data Generation
 ● Function Used: generate_synthetic_data()
 ● Steps:
 1. Used Scikit-learn's make_blobs function to generate a synthetic
 dataset.
 2. Parameters specified:
 ■ n_samples=1200: The total number of data points.
 ■ n_features=2: Each data point has two features
 (dimensions).
 ■ n_clusters=3: Data is grouped into three clusters.
 ■ cluster_std=0.8: The standard deviation controls cluster
 spread.
 ■ random_state=42: Ensures reproducibility.
3. The function returns:
 ■ X: Feature matrix of shape (1200, 2).
 ■ true_labels: Ground truth cluster labels (not used during
 clustering but useful for validation).
 4. This synthetic dataset simulates real-world patterns with distinct
 clusters.
 2.2 Data Preprocessing
 ● Function Used: preprocess_data()
 ● Steps:
 1. Data was scaled using Scikit-learn's StandardScaler to
 standardize the features.
 2. Standardization ensures the features have a mean of 0 and a
 standard deviation 1. This step prevents one feature from
 dominating clustering due to larger values.
 3. Result: A transformed dataset (X_scaled) with the same shape
 but normalized values.
 2.3 Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method)
 ● Function Used: determine_optimal_clusters()
 ● Steps:
 1. Tested K-Means clustering for a range of cluster values (k) from 1
 to 10.
 2. For each value of k:
 ■ Initialized a K-Means object with n_clusters=k,
 random_state=42, and n_init=10.
 ■ Fit the K-Means model on the standardized data
 (X_scaled).
 ■ Recorded the inertia: the sum of squared distances of data
 points to their nearest cluster center.
 3. Plotted the inertia values against the number of clusters (k) to form
 an "elbow curve."
 4. The "elbow point" was observed, where the rate of decrease in
 inertia slows significantly, suggesting k=3 as the optimal number of
 clusters.
 2.4 Clustering with K-Means
● Function Used: perform_kmeans_clustering()
 ● Steps:
 1. Initialized a K-Means model with the optimal number of clusters
 (n_clusters=3), random_state=42, and n_init=10.
 2. Fit the model on the scaled dataset (X_scaled).
 3. Computed:
 ■ Cluster labels (labels): Assign each data point to a
 cluster.
 ■ Cluster centers: Centroids representing the mean position
 of each cluster.
 4. Result: Three clusters were identified, with data points grouped.
 2.5 Evaluation Metrics
 ● Function Used: evaluate_clustering()
 ● Steps:
 1. Calculated the Silhouette Score using Scikit-learn's
 silhouette_score:
 ■ Measures the separation and compactness of clusters. A
 higher value (close to 1) indicates better-defined clusters.
 ■ Result: Silhouette Score = 0.7463.
 2. Retrieved the inertia from the K-Means model:
 ■ Indicates the tightness of clusters. Lower values are better.
 ■ Result: Inertia = 1023.21.
 3. Both metrics confirmed the clustering results were effective.
 2.6 Visualization
 ● Function Used: visualize_clusters()
 ● Steps:
 1. Plotted the data points on a 2D scatter plot using Matplotlib.
 2. Colored points based on their assigned cluster labels (labels).
 3. Marked the cluster centroids with red crosses.
 4. Added visual enhancements:
 ■ Title: "K-Means Clustering of Synthetic Data"
 ■ Labels for x-axis and y-axis
 ■ Colorbar indicating cluster labels
 ■ Gridlines for better readability
5. The visualization showed separated clusters and accurately
 positioned centroids.
 3. Findings
 3.1 Optimal Clusters
 ● TheElbow method identified k=3 as the optimal number of clusters.
 3.2 Clustering Performance
 ● Silhouette Score: 0.7463 (high, indicating well-defined clusters).
 ● Inertia: 1023.21 (low, indicating tight clusters).
 ● These metrics validate that the K-Means algorithm performed effectively.
 4. Challenges and Insights
 1. Determining Optimal Clusters:
 ○ TheElbow method can be subjective, especially in datasets with gradual
 changes in inertia.
 2. Scaling:
 ○ Standardization of features was important for balanced clustering.
 3. Initialization Stability:
 ○ Multiple initializations (n_init=10) minimized the risk of suboptimal
 results caused by poor centroid initialization.
 4. Synthetic Nature of Data:
 ○ While synthetic data ensures clear clusters, real-world datasets may
 introduce noise and overlapping clusters.
 5. Conclusion
 ● This project demonstrated the K-Means algorithm's effectiveness in clustering
 synthetic data. It highlighted the importance of preprocessing, cluster evaluation,
 and visualization. The results provide a strong foundation for extending this
 workflow to real-world problems, possibly exploring more complex clustering
 algorithms for non-spherical or high-dimensional datasets
